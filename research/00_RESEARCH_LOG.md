A second theorem-level weakness was found. The fixed q=3 crossed-derivation calculation is algebraically sound, but the later claim that a concrete projective degree-(2,3) relation jet with exact Z_3 coefficients is itself an established carrier is too strong.

The mod-3 restricted Lie object uses a characteristic-3 p-operation. It cannot simply be scalar-extended to Z_3 as the same restricted-Lie structure. Therefore the exact pair (R,P_3) over Z_3 has not been independently defined in the required sense.

Correct status: fixed full relation + exact crossed derivation = PASS/CLOSED; intrinsic mod-9 projective degree-(2,3) carrier = PASS/CLOSED; concrete exact two-component degree-(2,3) carrier => full chi = OPEN; naive Z_3 restricted-Lie scalar extension = FAIL/CLOSED.

## 2026-09-19 — HARD ATTACK 3: universal exact Fox obstruction carrier

The exact-carrier search was reopened with a genuinely different object type rather than a scalar extension of the characteristic-3 restricted Lie carrier. For a fixed minimal one-relator presentation, define the universal Laurent coefficient ring A=Z_3[T_1^{±1},...,T_d^{±1}] and the unevaluated twisted Fox-Jacobian row J_r=(tau(partial r/partial x_i)), tau(x_i)=T_i. The carrier is defined independently of any candidate orientation; a character is recovered only after evaluating T_i at its values and solving J_r=0.

For r=x_1^3[x_1,x_2][x_3,x_4], the row is J_1=1+A+A^2/B, J_2=A^2(A-1)/B, J_3=A^3(D^{-1}-1)/C, J_4=A^3(1-C^{-1})/D. On 1+3Z_3 the zero locus is uniquely A=C=D=1, B=-1/2. Thus a fixed-presentation finite exact algebraic carrier recovering the full orientation has been obtained.

This does not yet solve intrinsicity: arbitrary minimal free-basis changes must be shown to induce the corresponding Laurent-torus coordinate change and transform the obstruction ideal covariantly. Relator conjugation/unit changes must also be checked. The object is not finite information; it contains exact 3-adic coefficient data in a finitely generated algebraic presentation.

Decision:
- fixed-presentation universal Fox carrier: PASS/CLOSED;
- non-circular input definition: PASS/CLOSED;
- q=3 full-orientation recovery: PASS/CLOSED;
- presentation-independent/intrinsic carrier: OPEN;
- two-component degree-(2,3) compression: OPEN.
